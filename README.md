# C#-basics: WPF

.NET desktop application have seen some different approaches during the frameworks history. Windows Forms, Silverlight and others are still something that might be used in certain environments due to legacy applications. Current Windows-PC apps done with .NET C# are implemented mostly with WPF and the similar XAML-code is also used in web app environments. XAML is also used with Xamarin which again is another .NET related approach. You can eventually see terms like MVVM and others when building WPF apps, but in this set of tasks we test out simple operations with WPF applications.
