# Task 4

On this folder you can find a pre made Snake-game. The game should compile and run properly i.e. it shouldn't crash. The game should look something like this:

![IntelliSense](/../master/Images/3_P1.PNG?raw=true)

The game itself is a simple "Snake"-game, meaning that you control a snake with the arrow-buttons and collect the red dots on the screen. Each time to collect a point, the length of the snake is incremented and a new bonus point should appear. The game are should be restricted to the size of the window and it should not able to crash with itself. If either of those situations happen, the game should end.

However the game has certain bugs or unifinished features in it which you need to fix or create if the features are missing(Note the above description about the game, some of the missing features are described only there). Start the game and test it to see what bugs appear when you play it. Your target on this task is to fix the bugs and the missing features and then **git commit and push** your fixes to the repository.

Note that there's more than just 1 bug on the game, so test the behaviour properly and read the above game description through atleast 2 times.
